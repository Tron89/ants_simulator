# ants_simulator
Is a simulator of ants :D

## TASKS
I have to reorder ALL, the code, the files, and the README.md

## OBJECTIVES
This is my plan, I don't know how far I will go, but for when I'm bored:

1. First Step
   - Create the environment
   - Create the ants
   - Implement an default basic erratic movement for the ants
   - Basic collision detection
2. Second Step
   - Create basics objects and food
   - External nest (the entrance, without tunels)
   - Interactive Visualization
   - Communication through pheromones
   - Route optimization (through pheromones)
   - Food detection and return to nest
3. Third Step
   - Limited resources
   - Life and death
   - Setting parameters configuration
   - Exploration and Avoidance of Obstacles
   - Advanced collision detection
   - Nest creation??
4. Fourth Step
   - Ants types
   - Multiple colonies
   - War
   - Others predators
5. Fifth Step (2024 objective >:D)
   - Genetic improvement (through a genetic algorithm?)
   - Social interaction
6. Sixth Step (to play)
   - Change in the environment
   - Climatic events
   - Seasonal cycle
   - Diseases

Everytime I finish a step(in the shabbiest way possible), I going to refactor the code to mantain a stable structure and order

## SPECIFICATION

### WORLD
Is going to be a continuous space with probably two levels.
It's to soon to say something more

### TECNOLOGY USED
~~I will use python with the pygame library to do the enviroment, using a grid or something~~
Nel, it only allows 200 ants to be placed(whith a basic collision system), and I want something more powerful.
Also I want to learn c++ so two in one

I going to use c++ with the SFML library.
It let me place 400 ants(with a basic collision system too), that's twice as much as with python and that's what I need >:D

### VISION
I want to create an environment that constantly amazes me, doing things I never expected and evolving in ways I couldn't have imagined. I want my creation to grow with me, continually surprising and challenging me, ultimately becoming something unique and extraordinary that I can be proud of.

Maybe I got a little excited

### ANTS DATA

Pheromone Communication
Ant colony optimization algorithms
